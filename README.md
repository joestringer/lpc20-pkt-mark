## Abstract

The 32-bit `mark` associated with the skb has served as a metadata exchange
format for Linux networking subsystems since the beginning of the century. Over
that time, the interpretation and reuse of the field has grown to encapsulate a
wide range of networking use cases, expanding to touch everything from
iptables, tc, xfrm, openvswitch, sockets, routing, to eBPF. In recent years,
more than a dozen network control applications have been written in the Cloud
Native space alone, many of which are using the packet mark in different ways
to solve networking problems. The kernel facilities define no specific
semantics to these bits, which leaves it up to these applications to
co-ordinate to avoid incompatible mark usage.

This talk will explore use cases for sharing metadata between Linux subsystems
in light of recent containerization trends, including but not limited to:
application identity, firewalling, ip masquerade, network isolation, service
proxying and transparent encryption. Beyond that, Cilium's particular usage
will be discussed with approaches used to mitigate conflicts due to the
inevitable overload of the mark.
