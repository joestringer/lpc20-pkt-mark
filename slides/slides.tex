        % Let's talk about the mark of the {beast}.
        %
        % First just want to highlight that I may use any of the following
        % interchangeably. There are some subtleties to the usage for instance
        % in that the ct_mark is associated with conntrack entries rather than
        % the skb, but it's still related to this area & used commonly in some
        % of the use cases I'll present shortly.
        %
        % Despite the lack of direct commentary and otherwise innocuous-looking
        % declaration, the semantics on these bits and how they're interpreted
        % by various subsystems is really quite interesting.
        %
        % These various names hint as to the various subsystems that may be
        % involved.
        %
        % firewall mark - interestingly not just firewall (ie drop), but also
        %                 used in policy routing
        % ct mark - storable & restorable from connection tracking entries
        % socket mark - allow user applications to communicate something to
        %               kernel networking subsystems
        % xfrm mark - policy-based packet transform, eg key selection
        % pkt mark - exposed through OVS up through OVN in logical router
        %            policy.
        %
        % Also found SECMARK on my way here, but that seems to be an
        % integration specifically with SELinux security contexts and AFAICT
        % is not actually working with the mark.

    % So what's my interest? Well, I co-maintain a piece of network software
    % called Cilium which provides eBPF-based networking, security and
    % observability for cloud-native workloads.
    %
    % Cilium is a heavy user of the mark. There's a lot of features it provides
    % and many of them have ties in to the mark. I'll go into more detail on a
    % bunch of these later in the presentation. Most of the features you see
    % on the page here are somehow backed by the mark.
    %
    % Cilium is also built to be modular so that you can enable / disable
    % certain functionality. If you want to run other networking software for
    % the base networking connectivity, you're quite welcome to - we have a
    % half dozen getting started guides in the Cilium documentation for various
    % other network plugins.
    %
    % So what I'm interested to look at here is *interoperability*. How do
    % network control software writers use the mark in ways that allow other
    % software to also work?

    % The thing is... there's a whole bunch of other plugins. This image is

    % out there, but it's not comprehensive. Not counting commercial projects
    % here. (But if you know how a commercial project is using the mark, it'd
    % be awesome to have that documented in the fwmark registry too!)
    %
    % *NOT* covering the whole host of other software that has been previously
    % written. There'll be some overlap and I'd welcome any discussion on that

        %
        % Leads into... How many bits do we need?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Bitwise usage~\smallskip
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Simpler interoperability~\smallskip
            \end{itemize}
            \item Full-mark~\smallskip
            \begin{itemize}
                \item More values to work with~\smallskip
                \item Most usage doesn't make use of this~\medskip
            \end{itemize}

            \begin{itemize}
                \item ...but there's only 32 bits to play with?~\smallskip
            \end{itemize}
            \item Mitigation: Encode meaning in bit range~\smallskip
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Use [0x0000..0x000F] rather than bits in 0xFFFF~\medskip
                % Depending on how complicated you want to get, this may not work.
                % Example: "0xA" implies the uppermost 8 bits have some meaning.
                %          May be possible with eBPF, but not with routing layer.
            \end{itemize}
            \item Mitigation: Overload bits on different paths~\smallskip
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Ingress / Egress~\smallskip
                \item Make semantics dependent on packet fields~\medskip
            \end{itemize}
                % So great, now we have semantic overlap for bits in the system.
                % Can't imagine any way that's going to be a problem...
                %
                % Leads into how really the push for interoperability should
                % be driven by usage. No point solving this if people aren't
                % asking for it. Then how do we make the boundaries clear.

    %\begin{frame}{Interoperability}
    \begin{frame}{Sharing is caring}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Driven by common deployment scenarios~\medskip
                % All Kubernetes networking plugins respect bit 15: DROP
                %
                % It's difficult to arbitrarily support integration with other
                % plugins, because you don't necessarily know the ways that
                % they're configuring the stack.
            \item The clearer responsibility assignment you have, the better~\medskip
                % Example: When Cilium provides just network policy on top of
                %          another plugin for connectivity, we know we won't
                %          have to configure the encryption bits.
                %
                % More difficult is when you're integrating with arbitrary
                % iptables rules so you don't know if your traffic will be
                % messed with and you also don't know if the mark will be
                % thrashed...
            \item Not free (in effort or in complexity)~\medskip
            % What features do you need / what are you trading off?
            % \item At what point do you lose the benefit of independent
            %       software implementations and should just implement the
            %       functionality yourself?
            %
            % Scope changes depending on how ambitious you are. Cilium aims to
            % allow swapping in/out routing / service layers.
            % Means that when you run alternative implementation, there must be
            % co-ordination.

            % Which leads into how the mark usage isn't just about mark usage,
            % it's also about which fields you're matching and which order of
            % features / rules you hit, which combination of subsystems you
            % hit, how they're programmed.
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{frame}{One does not simply understand skb mark}
        % Mark doesn't operate in a vacuum. Ultimately you must not only
        % understand whether to set/not set specific bits, but depending on
        % which features you intend to reuse, you may need to understand how
        % other logic is triggered.
        %
        % There's this other aspect here where it's really up to each project
        % that cares to figure out the potential bitwise conflict with other
        % individual projects.

            \item Consolidate subsystem usage~\medskip

                %
                % Don't split half your logic into iptables. Embrace eBPF if
                % that's where you're at. Or embrace OVS if that's your stack.
            \item Extend generic mark space?~\medskip
                % CONFIG\_SKB\_EXTENSIONS
                %
                % Here's where I'm curious to get more feedback from the
                % audience. Is this a pain point for you?
            \item Formalize some use cases?~\medskip
                % Maybe one of the use cases I mentioned could be handled with
                % explicit APIs for certain subsystems, maybe skb extensions
                % or control block or something behind the scenes. Or maybe
                % you have another use case?
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}

    % There's some interesting angle here for Cilium's perspective. We've been
    % able to flesh out a whole bunch of use cases by making use of the mark,
    % occasionally maximising the number of bits such that some combinations of
    % features cannot be enabled at the same time. The great thing here is that
    % we can build out that support on any kernel version.
    %
    % Downsides: Debuggability, less ability to integrate due to mark overload,
    % related: maintenance, education. More complex. Now we're starting to look
    % at specific directions where we can extend eBPF to provide primitives
    % that allow us to simplify (``remove boxes'' from arch diagram) and
    % optimize performance by eliminating unnecessary infrastructure.
    %
    % One of the big angles we're looking at now is to move the last few bits
    % of iptables usage into eBPF directly.

    % TODO: Revisit this:
    % I think we're trying to answer the question "Does the mark work?" here.
    % Obviously it is functional for specific use cases, but does it broadly
    % provide an interoperability story for network control software?

    \begin{frame}{Summary}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Powerful mechanism for cross-subsystem programming~\medskip
                % No predefined semantics assignment. Lots of freedom to define
                % those when programming the kernel.
                %
                % Presented several use cases that are common across multiple
                % Kubernetes network plugins.
            \item Uncertainty when bits are OK to use~\medskip
                % Hopefully the fwmark registry will help with this, but that
                % relies on your participation, hint hint!
                %
                % This is not necessarily enough to guarantee interoperability,
                % but it's a first step to providing vision in the darkness.
            %\item Can be a crutch~\medskip
                % Starts out fixing this one hacky case, ends up with mark overload
            \item There are more uses than there are bits~\medskip
                % Many use cases can get away with just one bit. If everything
                % is like that, then 32 is plenty. Extra metadata or hogging
                % the bits works against this though.
                %
                % And when you run out of bits, the ``fun'' starts.
                % Both from design perspective but also from deploy/debug cycle
